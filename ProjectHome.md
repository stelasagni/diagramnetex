## NEW! Looking for a new owner (06/2010) ##

Diagram.Net receives more than 1600 unique visitors/month and has been downloaded more than 1600 times. There are a lot of people looking for a free and open diagram solution. Cool!
But unfortunately it's not receiving updates anymore. Would you like to improve and keep this community alive? We are looking for a new project owner. Send me a email and let me know why you want to be the new owner member and how you can improve it. dalssoft(at)gmail.com

**Update:** I'm willing to give the project ownership to those who can contribute with some critical or high items on the issue list. It will help people to understand the code and I could help the person with the design/architecture of the classes, etc. Reasonable, right?
